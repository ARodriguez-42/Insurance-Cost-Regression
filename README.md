# Insurance-Cost-Regression

I undertook a project utilizing the Medical Cost Personal Datasets from Kaggle, aiming to predict medical insurance costs based on various attributes. The project involved extensive data preprocessing using Pandas, including one-hot encoding categorical variables. To explore the predictive performance of linear regression models, I constructed several variations: a baseline Linear Regression model, an augmented model with feature scaling and Polynomial Features, a model employing K-fold Cross-Validation for robustness assessment, as well as Lasso and Ridge regression models for regularization. Through thorough evaluation, it was found that the Ridge regression model outperformed others, exhibiting the highest R<sup>2</sup> score, thus demonstrating its suitability for this predictive task.
